# Intro to RSS

Welcome to Robotics: Science and Systems!

## Lab 1 A-B: Overview

In this lab, 
we will learn about and gain experience with Linux operating systems, Docker images, Git and GitHub. 

In this class, you will be using the Debian Linux distribution as your operating system, 
as it is widely used in robotics and supports the robotics software we will be using. 
Since you may not want to replace your current operating system, 
you can use a Docker image to run another operating system within your current operating system. 

This class relies heavily on team software development, 
so we will need tools for collaborating and synchronizing each otherâ€™s work. 
Git is the version control system that we will be using for this purpose. 
All the Git-controlled projects, including the Lab instructions and support software, 
will be accessible on GitHub, an online service for hosting Git repositories.

#### Setup

For this lab, you will need access to a Debian-based (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu) shell.
